# Minecraft for Apple Silicon
Minecraft 1.17.1 for Apple Silicon

**DOES NOT WORK YET**

Steps
-----

1. Simply create a folder called `arm-1.17` inside yout `minecraft/versions` folder and put `arm-1.17.1.json` inside.
2. Create a new profile using this version
3. In the launcher specify a ARM Java Machine
4. Play!

It does not work yet because `java-objc-bridge` is not compatible yet with Apple Silicon.

Future work: Fabric compatibility
